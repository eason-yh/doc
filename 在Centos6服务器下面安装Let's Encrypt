在Centos6服务器下面安装Let's Encrypt

服务器必须安装有nginx服务，并在nginx下配有网站目录和域名

服务器下创建一个目录 test
在test目录中执行如下命令：
wget https://dl.eff.org/certbot-auto
chmod a+x certbot-auto

创建一个文件：demo.com.conf
文件中内容如下：
domains = demo.com
rsa-key-size = 3072
email = demo@demo.com
text = True

authenticator = webroot
webroot-path = /var/www/html

domains和emai需要改成自己的域名以及用于从Let’s Encrypt接收证书信息的邮箱，rsa-key-size推荐使用2048或者3072

配置完之后执行如下命令：
./certbot-auto -c demo.com.conf certonly

之后会出现一些英文信息：

Obtaining a new certificate
Performing the following challenges:

Using the webroot path /nginx/vhost/Test for all unmatched domains.

Cleaning up challenges

IMPORTANT NOTES:
 - Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at:
   Let's Encrypt/fullchain.pem
   Your key file has been saved at:
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/.com/privkey.pem
   Your cert will expire on 2018-10-18. To obtain a new or tweaked
   version of this certificate in the future, simply run certbot-auto
   again. To non-interactively renew *all* of your certificates, run
   "certbot-auto renew"
 - Your account credentials have been saved in your Certbot
   configuration directory at /etc/letsencrypt. You should make a
   secure backup of this folder now. This configuration directory will
   also contain certificates and private keys obtained by Certbot so
   making regular backups of this folder is ideal.
 - If you like Certbot, please consider supporting our work by:

   Donating to ISRG / Let's Encrypt:   https://letsencrypt.org/donate
   Donating to EFF:                    https://eff.org/donate-le
   
   
   
如上出现 - Congratulations 证明注册证书成功
证书文件位置：/etc/letsencrypt/live/xxx.com/

之后就是配置nginx的https跳转了

证书续费执行命令：./certbot-auto renew
申请的证书为3个月的有效期，如果未到期执行会出现提示证书未到期，可以提前申请续期，但是时间不要差太长
